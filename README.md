```

Publish the config file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Patrikgrinsvall\LaravelBankid\LaravelBankidServiceProvider" --tag="laravel_bankid-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    "BANKID_ENDPOINT"           => "https://appapi2.bankid.com/rp/v5.1",
    "BANKID_SSL_CERT"           => "storage/certs/bankidprod/customername.crt.pem"
    "BANKID_CA_CERT"            => storage/certs/bankidprod/cacert.pem
    "BANKID_SSL_KEY"            => storage/certs/bankidprod/private.key.pem
    "BANKID_SSL_KEY_PASSWORD"   => xxxx
];
```

## Usage
- Composer install
- All dependencies should be auto discovered since larvel 8 so no need to register service provider. 
- If above doesnt work, register service provider `Patrikgrinsvall\LaravelBankid\BankidServiceProvider` in `config/app.php`
- In your routes, define what route prefix to use for bankid authentication, example: 
  `Route::LaravelBankid('/bankid');` 
- To test it works, browse to your local environment and to the prefix choosen above.
- Start a bankid authentication you can either use facade: ```
use Patrikgrinsvall\LaravelBankid\BankidFacade;
...

Bankid::login(); // <-- will redirect user to login flow and ask for pnr etc.
```
- After bankid authentication is completed you can get the bankid details like `Bankid::user()`
- 

## Testing
